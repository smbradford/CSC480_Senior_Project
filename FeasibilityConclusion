Problems:
- Understanding the data given to us by the CFC.
- Cleansing the CFC data so that is formatted correctly for a SQL Server database, as well as for use with Shiny R.
- Understanding what our client wants us to present to them.

Skill set:
- Shiny - We are all familiar with Shiny, but could brush up on our skills
- SQL Server - Not a new skill, but again, more brushing up on our skills
- Excel - This isn't something we're incredibly skilled in, but seems easy enough to pick up

Software:
- R Studio
- SQL Server
- Excel
- A mail client

Hardware:
- A computer that can run SQL Server, since this will be our heaviest piece of software

Time:
- Once we run through some issues with our client, we should be able to knock out this project in a few weeks with a few hours of work between us per week

Client Access:
- We are working on communicating more with our client and have set up an appointment to clarify issues, see if we're heading in the right direction


Feasibility Conclusion:
- In conclusion, we believe that we will be able to complete our Senior Project for the CFC, after we meet with them again to clarify some key parts of our project. There are a few skills to brush up on, but that shouldn't take time away from the project.

My Responsibilities
- Cleaning data in preparation for ETL to a SQL Server database.
